# SOGI Chatbot

The SOGI Chatbot is a prototype chatbot, designed by Tugay Uzinli for his graduation project.<br />

<pre>
Filing a declaration is a task that many people regard as "a lot of work for a fairly simple task".
In addition, forms are regularly submitted incorrectly, which increases the waiting time for payment.
To improve these user unfriendliness, a smart chatbot prototype will be build.
This chatbot will become the new virtual assistant for Sogeti employees.
The task of our new virtual assistant colleague is to submit claims error-free and, above all, quickly.
</pre>

Version 1.0 will be a static online version which should contain all the steps in the declaration flow<br />
Version 1.1 will use data from IBM Watson<br />
Version 1.2 will include the second flow, with the calendar<br />
